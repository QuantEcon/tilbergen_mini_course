# Computational Economics with Python

## Graduate Mini Course at Tilbergen Institute


* Primary instructor: John Stachurski
* Assistant instructor: Natasha Watkins
* Dates: 4th--7th June
* Class times: 9am--12 noon
* Location: TBA


### Summary

This mini course will provide a fast paced introduction to Python for
computational economic modeling, from basic scripting to high performance
computing.  The course is aimed at graduate students with proficiency in at
least one scientific computing platform (e.g, MATLAB, Fortran, STATA, R, C or
Julia).

No Python knowledge is assumed.  

### Schedule


#### Day 1

* Python vs MATLAB vs Julia vs Fortran vs others
* The Python language: syntax and semantics
* [Jupyter notebooks](http://jupyter.org/)

* [Numba](http://numba.pydata.org/) and other JIT compilers
* Parallelization
* Distributed and cloud computing

#### Day 3

* Applications in economic and financial modeling 

    * asset pricing 
    * optimal savings 
    * optimal stopping

#### Day 4
